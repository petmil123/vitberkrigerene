    "Polymerphysics has become an increasingly important subject within various scientific disciplines in the recent years, most notably perhaps in the description of biopolymers like DNA. DNA-strands go through multiple essential and incricate processes of folding, for example when an entire DNA-strand must confine itself within the nuclues of a cell. Errors in this folding has been linked to numerous hereditary diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease. This project aims to explore and replicate the folding of polymers using Monte Carlo-methods, involving stochastic simulations."

    "**(1a)** To begin this process, it is necessery to implement a polymer and corresponding functions needed for rotations and visualization. There are several ways to implement the polymer, one way is to use an $N \\times N$ matrix containing the index of each individual monomer. Another possibility, the one used for this project, is to store the polymer as a list of length $N$ where each element of the list is a list of length two, containing the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the monomer with the respective index. Note that these polymers are zero-indexed, as the numpy arrays used are zero-indexed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of going for this approach is that operations done on the entirety of the data structure achieves an asymptotic runtime of $O(N)$, and an order of magnitude better than $O(N^2)$ for the $N \\times N$ matrix approach (note that constant time is assumed for the element-wise operation). This is achieved while the structure is still compatible with numpy, gaining the advantage of its fast implementations and parallell computing possibilities.\n",

This rotation will not alter the energy at all. Changes in energy in polymers due to rotation arise when monomers that were not previously interacting are placed such that an interaction arises, or vice versa. As a rotation around a monomer at the endpoint rotates the entire polymer, no relative distances are altered. Therefore, when simulating random rotations, such rotations can be disregarded without consequences for the final result. \n",

Varying numbers of attempted rotations reveal different stabilization percentages with longer polymers showing lower stabilization values. This is likely due to their higher probability of attempting invalid rotations. A long polymer is more likely to fold over itself, because it has more opportunities for segments to intersect or overlap. Imagine a long line as having numerous segments or regions that can potentially cross over each other when rotated. In contrast, a short line has fewer segments or regions, reducing the chances of intersection or overlap when rotated. "

    "The plot illustrates that polymers at lower temperatures swiftly converge to a rotation that positions them within a local energy minimum. Notably, the majority of polymers reach their initial local minima within the first 0-100 rotations. Subsequently, once situated within an energy minimum, the polymer's available energy-efficient rotation possibilities become limited. Consequently, the polymer refrains from executing rotations until an energy-efficient option is identified. However, occasional deviations from this behavior occur, characterized by energy-inefficient rotations, primarily attributed to thermal fluctuations as discussed in [2b](#task2b)."

Here, the Metropolis algorithm is extended to provide $d(T)$, which represents the maximum distance between two monomers in the polymer for every rotation done. To achieve this, cdist is used to calculate this distance. cdist computes the pairwise distances between the N monomers in a polymer, with the \"euclid\" parameter indicating the use of the Euclidean distance metric."
