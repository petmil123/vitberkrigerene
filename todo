=====INSTRUKS:======
NÃ¥r du har gjort noe, skriv Done og navn etter punktet
Om man legger til nytt punkt, sett initialer foran
_______________________________________________________

Overordnet: All plots should be discussed, and they must have physical units
when necessary. 
Your code should be well-documented and structured

1a) Calculate trajectory for t \in [0,50] using Heun
Try different timesteps and compare results by plotting trajectories for different timesteps
in same plot
What seems like a reasonable timestep?
What happens if you double the time? Is same timestep good?

1b)
100 initial conditions, calculate trajectory for each particle for t \in [0,10]
In the same plot, show scatters of initial and final pos, as well as trajectories that
connect.

1c)
Test implementation by measuring time to run for different numbers of particles, plot of runtime as function of N_p
Why is the run time approx. constant for small N_p?

2a)
Choose suitable N_p and transport particles over 5 days. Plot trajectories in xy-coords

2b)
Use attached code to plot trajectories on map.
Using figs 1 and 2, try selecting other positions, and repeat simulation

3)
Use this to modify the behaviour of the particles s.t. they stop if they reach land

3a)
Use suitable values for N_p and justify choice.
Make plot that shows final positions of stranded particles,
for example scatter to show final pos, with different colors for stranded and seaborn parts.
Include plot showing percentage of stranded particles as function of time

3b)
Try different windage factors and how they affect results, for example
percentage of stranded after three days as function of f_w.
