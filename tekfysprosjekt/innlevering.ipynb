    "Sometime about 500 years ago, famed explorer Ferdinand Magellan said: \"The sea is dangerous and its storms terrible, but these obstacles have never been sufficient reason to remain ashore.\" This quote is mainly about respecting the power of the sea, then with unknown powers. Although the power of the sea never should be underestimated, we are at this day and age able to measure and even predict its power in ocean and wind currents through numerical simulations. These simulations have mulitple usages, and was for example used to caluclate the trajectory of oilspill after the explosion on the oil platform Deepwater Horizon in 2010. In the future these simulations will remain highly relevant due to the oceans increasing amount of plastics. This report will use recorded data of ocean and wind currents to attempt to implement these simulations to predict the trajectory of plastics at sea level along the Norwegian coast.\n",
